# Brain Receiver
The Brain Receiver is the interface for the [Brain Collector](https://code.fbi.h-da.de/mlops-brain/brain_collector) and the other BRAIN services. Therefore, Brain Receiver gets the data from the UI of the Brain Collector. This data is used to check for datadrift in [Brain Monitor](https://code.fbi.h-da.de/mlops-brain/brain_monitor), for Predictions on the current deployed model in [Brain Inference](https://code.fbi.h-da.de/mlops-brain/brain_inference) or for data enrichment in [Brain data](https://code.fbi.h-da.de/mlops-brain/brain_data).
