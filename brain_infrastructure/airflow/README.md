# Airflow
This was very painfull to setup.
Shout out to this blog:  [Blog that saved my life here](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/docker-compose/index.html)

Anyways, to get airflow running with our setup "simply" fill out the `db.env` and `.env` file and run `docker-compose up -d --build`.
